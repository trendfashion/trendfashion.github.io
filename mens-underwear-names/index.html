They provide the support of briefs while still offering the coverage of traditional boxers. They're a popular style for men who want the best of both worlds. I personally prefer boxer briefs because they offer the right amount of support without feeling too constricting.

They're a popular choice for men who engage in physical activity or want to avoid bunching or sagging. Briefs offer little coverage and are not a great option for men who prefer a looser fit. Keywords related to briefs include support, tight-fitting, and coverage.</p><h2>Jockstraps</h2><p>Jockstraps are a unique style of underwear that's designed for athletic support. They consist of a pouch that holds the genitals and two straps that go around the buttocks. Jockstraps are a popular choice for athletes who need maximum support during physical activity.
