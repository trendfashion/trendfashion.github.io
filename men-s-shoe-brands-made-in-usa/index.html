Firstly, think about your specific needs. Do you need dress shoes for work, or are you in the market for a new pair of sneakers? Different brands specialize in different styles, so it's essential to choose a brand that aligns with your needs.</p><p>Additionally, consider the brand's commitment to quality and craftsmanship. Look for brands that use high-quality materials and skilled labor to create their shoes. This will ensure that your shoes last and provide value for your investment.</p><p><h2>Thorogood</h2></p><p>Thorogood is a Wisconsin-based brand that has been creating work boots since 1892.
