From power dressing to punk rock, the fashion designers of the time created iconic looks that still influence fashion today. In this post, we'll take a look back at the top fashion designers of the 80's and their lasting impact.</p><p>The 80's were a time of excess and extravagance, and fashion was no exception. However, not everyone was a fan of the bold and often garish looks that were popular at the time. Many people found the styles to be over-the-top and impractical for everyday wear.</p><p>Despite the backlash, the top fashion designers of the 80's continued to push boundaries and create designs that were both innovative and daring. Their influence can still be seen in fashion today, with many designers drawing inspiration from the iconic looks of the era.</p><p>In this post, we'll explore the lasting impact of the top fashion designers of the 80's, from their signature styles to their most famous collections.</p><h2>The Iconic Designs of Gianni Versace</h2><p>Gianni Versace was one of the most influential fashion designers of the 80's, known for his bold prints and daring designs. His signature style was all about excess and glamour, and his collections often featured bright colors and flashy fabrics.</p><p>I remember seeing a Versace dress in a magazine when I was a teenager and being absolutely mesmerized by it. The bright colors and bold patterns were like nothing I had ever seen before, and I knew then that fashion was something I wanted to be a part of.</p><p>Versace's most famous collection was his Spring/Summer 1991 show, which featured supermodels like Naomi Campbell and Linda Evangelista walking down the runway in his signature bold prints and bright colors.

Known for her punk rock aesthetic, Westwood's designs were all about rebellion and individuality.</p><p>I remember seeing a pair of Westwood's iconic platform shoes in a vintage store and feeling like I had to have them. They were so different from anything else I had ever seen, and I loved that they were a little bit rebellious.</p><p>Westwood's most famous collection was her Spring/Summer 1981 show, which featured her signature punk rock designs like safety pins and ripped denim. The collection was a reflection of the rebellious spirit of the time, and it cemented Westwood's place as one of the top fashion designers of the 80's.</p><h3>The Innovative Designs of Jean Paul Gaultier</h3><p>Jean Paul Gaultier was another fashion designer who had a major impact on the 80's fashion scene. Known for his innovative designs and use of unconventional materials, Gaultier's collections were always pushing boundaries.</p><p>I remember seeing Gaultier's famous cone bra on Madonna during her Blonde Ambition tour and being blown away. It was such a daring and unexpected design, and it perfectly captured the spirit of the time.</p><p>Gaultier's most famous collection was his Spring/Summer 1984 show, which featured his signature designs like corsets and leather jackets. The collection was a celebration of individuality and self-expression, and it solidified Gaultier's place as one of the top fashion designers of the 80's.</p><h4>The Timeless Designs of Ralph Lauren</h4><p>While many of the top fashion designers of the 80's were all about pushing boundaries and being daring, Ralph Lauren took a different approach. Known for his timeless designs and classic Americana aesthetic, Lauren's collections were always elegant and sophisticated.</p><p>I remember seeing a Ralph Lauren collection when I was in college and being struck by how effortlessly chic it was. The pieces were simple and understated, but they had a timeless quality that made them feel special.</p><p>Lauren's most famous collection was his Fall/Winter 1981 show, which featured his signature preppy style and classic silhouettes. The collection was a celebration of American style, and it cemented Lauren's place as one of the top fashion designers of the 80's.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><p><strong>Q: What were some of the most popular trends in 80's fashion?</strong></p><p>A: Some of the most popular trends of the 80's were power dressing, punk rock, and new wave.
