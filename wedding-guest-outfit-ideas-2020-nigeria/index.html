You want to look your best while adhering to the dress code and cultural norms. With wedding season in full swing, it's time to start planning your outfits. In this post, we'll be sharing wedding guest outfit ideas for 2020 Nigeria.</p><p>If you're attending a Nigerian wedding, you'll want to dress in traditional attire or something that reflects the vibrant culture. But even if you're not Nigerian, it's important to dress appropriately for the occasion. You don't want to be underdressed or overdressed, and you certainly don't want to upstage the bride or groom.</p><p>So, what should you wear? Here are a few wedding guest outfit ideas for 2020 Nigeria:</p><p><h2>1. Ankara Gowns</h2></p><p>One of the most popular Nigerian fabrics is Ankara, and you can't go wrong with an Ankara gown. These dresses come in a variety of styles, from simple and elegant to bold and colorful. Pair with a gele (headscarf) and some statement jewelry for a truly Nigerian look.</p><p><h2>2. Agbada</h2></p><p>If you're looking for something more traditional, consider an Agbada. This is a flowing robe worn by men and women and can be made from various fabrics, including lace and Ankara. Pair with a headwrap and some statement earrings for a stylish look.</p><p><h2>3. Lace Dresses</h2></p><p>Lace is a popular fabric choice for Nigerian weddings, and a lace dress is a timeless option that can be dressed up or down. Opt for a midi or maxi length, and pair with statement heels and a clutch.</p><p><h2>4. Jumpsuits</h2></p><p>If you're not a fan of dresses, a jumpsuit is a great alternative. Look for one with a bold print or vibrant color to stand out, and pair with statement jewelry and heels.</p><p><h3>5. Gele</h3></p><p>A gele is a headscarf that is typically worn with traditional Nigerian attire. It can be tied in various styles and is a great way to add some color and personality to your outfit. If you're not sure how to tie a gele, there are plenty of tutorials online.</p><p><h4>6. Accessories</h4></p><p>Accessories are key when it comes to completing your wedding guest outfit. Opt for statement jewelry, like oversized earrings or a chunky necklace, to add some sparkle to your look. A clutch or small handbag is also essential for carrying your essentials.</p><p>So there you have it, our top wedding guest outfit ideas for 2020 Nigeria. Remember to dress appropriately for the occasion, but don't be afraid to add some personality and flair to your outfit.</p><p><h2>Personal Experience</h2></p><p>As someone who has attended Nigerian weddings, I can attest to the vibrancy and beauty of the traditional attire. I've worn both an Ankara gown and a lace dress to weddings, and always received compliments on my outfit. It's important to do your research and understand the cultural norms when attending a Nigerian wedding, but don't be afraid to have fun with your outfit.</p><p><h2>Where to Shop</h2></p><p>If you're looking to purchase traditional Nigerian attire, there are plenty of online stores that specialize in African fashion. Some popular options include D'iyanu, Grass-fields, and Zuvaa.</p><p><h3>How to Style</h3></p><p>When styling your wedding guest outfit, it's important to consider the dress code and cultural norms. If you're unsure, it's always better to err on the side of caution and dress more conservatively. Opt for bold colors and prints, and don't be afraid to accessorize with statement jewelry and a headwrap.</p><p><h4>What Colors to Wear</h4></p><p>Colors are an important part of Nigerian culture, and certain shades have specific meanings. For example, red is associated with love and passion, while green symbolizes fertility and prosperity. When choosing your outfit, consider incorporating these colors into your look.</p><p><h2>Question and Answer</h2></p><p><strong>Q: Can I wear a white dress to a Nigerian wedding?</strong></p><p>A: It's generally best to avoid wearing white to a wedding, as it's considered to be the color of mourning in Nigerian culture.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I wear pants to a Nigerian wedding?</strong></p><p>A: While it's not traditional for women to wear pants to Nigerian weddings, it's becoming more common. Just make sure to dress them up with statement heels and accessories.</p><p><strong>Q: Should I wear a headwrap to a Nigerian wedding?</strong></p><p>A: If you're wearing traditional Nigerian attire, a headwrap (or gele) is a great way to complete your look. However, if you're wearing a Western-style dress, it's not necessary.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I wear a sleeveless dress to a Nigerian wedding?</strong></p><p>A: While sleeveless dresses are acceptable, it's best to avoid anything too revealing or low-cut. Nigerian weddings are typically conservative affairs.</p><p><h2>Conclusion of Wedding Guest Outfit Ideas 2020 Nigeria</h2></p><p>Attending a Nigerian wedding is a wonderful experience, and choosing the perfect outfit can be part of the fun. Whether you opt for traditional Nigerian attire or a Western-style dress, make sure to dress appropriately for the occasion. Don't forget to accessorize with statement jewelry and a clutch, and have fun with your outfit!</p></article>
