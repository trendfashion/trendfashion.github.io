Movies that have stood the test of time and have a devoted following, yet somehow you've never even heard of them? Welcome to the world of cult classic movies!</p><p>Many people are unaware of the existence of cult classic movies, or they may think they're not interested in them. However, if you're someone who loves movies and wants to expand your horizons, you might be surprised by how much you enjoy these hidden gems.</p><p>If you're not sure what a cult classic movie is, don't worry - we've got you covered.</p><p>In this article, we'll be exploring what makes a movie a cult classic, providing some examples of cult classics you might want to check out, and discussing why these movies are worth watching.</p><h2>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</h2><p>The Rocky Horror Picture Show is perhaps one of the most well-known cult classic movies out there. This musical-comedy-horror film was released in 1975 and has been a cult favorite ever since.</p><p>Personally, I remember the first time I watched this movie - I was a teenager and had no idea what I was getting into. But from the moment the opening credits rolled, I was hooked. The catchy songs, the bizarre storyline, and the over-the-top performances by the cast all came together to create an experience that was unlike anything I'd ever seen before.</p><p>So, what makes The Rocky Horror Picture Show a cult classic? Well, for starters, it has a devoted fan base that has kept the movie alive for over 40 years. Fans of the movie often attend midnight screenings dressed in costume and ready to participate in the interactive elements of the film.</p><p>But beyond the fan culture surrounding the movie, The Rocky Horror Picture Show is simply a fun and unique movie that's worth checking out if you haven't seen it already.</p><h2>Donnie Darko</h2><p>Another example of a cult classic movie is Donnie Darko, a psychological thriller that was released in 2001. This movie follows the story of a troubled teenager named Donnie who starts experiencing strange visions and becomes convinced that the world is going to end.</p><p>I first watched Donnie Darko in college, and it quickly became one of my favorite movies. The film's mix of sci-fi, horror, and drama creates a sense of unease that stays with you long after the movie is over. And of course, there's the iconic giant rabbit costume that the character Frank wears - a symbol that has become synonymous with the movie.</p><p>Like The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Donnie Darko has a dedicated fan base that has kept the movie relevant years after its release. And while it may not be for everyone, it's definitely a movie worth watching if you're a fan of psychological thrillers or just want to experience something a little different.</p><h3>What Makes a Movie a Cult Classic?</h3><p>So, what exactly makes a movie a cult classic? There's no one answer to this question, as different movies become cult classics for different reasons. However, here are a few common factors that tend to contribute to a movie's cult status:</p><ul><li>The movie has a small but devoted fan base that keeps it relevant years after its release</li><li>The movie is often seen as "quirky" or "offbeat" compared to mainstream movies</li><li>The movie has a unique style or tone that sets it apart from other movies</li><li>The movie incorporates elements of fandom or encourages fan participation</li></ul><h4>How to Find Cult Classic Movies</h4><p>If you're interested in exploring the world of cult classic movies, there are a few ways to get started: <ul><li>Ask friends or family members who are into movies if they have any recommendations</li><li>Browse online forums or fan communities dedicated to specific movies or genres</li><li>Check out streaming services like Netflix or Hulu, which often have categories dedicated to cult classics</li><li>Visit your local video store (if you're lucky enough to have one still in business) and browse the cult classics section</li></ul><h2>The Room</h2><p>The Room is perhaps one of the most infamous cult classic movies out there. This 2003 drama film was written, directed, and produced by Tommy Wiseau, who also stars in the movie. The Room has been called one of the worst movies ever made, but that hasn't stopped it from gaining a cult following.</p><p>I first heard about The Room several years ago and decided to watch it out of curiosity. And let me tell you - it did not disappoint. The movie is so bad that it's good, with laughably bad acting, nonsensical dialogue, and bizarre plot twists.</p><p>While The Room may not be for everyone, it's definitely a movie that's worth watching if you're in the mood for something truly terrible (in a good way).</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><p>Q: Are cult classic movies always obscure or hard to find?</p><p>A: Not necessarily. While some cult classics may have had limited releases or be difficult to find, others have gained a wider audience over time and can be easily found on streaming services or in video stores.</p><p>Q: Do I have to be a fan of a specific genre to enjoy a cult classic movie?</p><p>A: No! While some cult classics may fall into specific genres (such as horror or sci-fi), many of them defy categorization and can appeal to a wide variety of audiences.</p><p>Q: Are cult classic movies always "so bad they're good"?</p><p>A: Not necessarily. While some cult classics (like The Room) may be known for their bad acting or low production values, others are simply unique or offbeat movies that have gained a devoted following over time.</p><p>Q: Can a movie become a cult classic right after it's released, or does it take time?</p><p>A: It can go either way! Some movies gain cult status almost immediately after they're released, while others may take years or even decades to find their audience.</p><h2>Conclusion of Examples of Cult Classic Movies</h2><p>So there you have it - a beginner's guide to examples of cult classic movies. Whether you're a die-hard movie fan or just looking for something new to watch, we hope this article has given you some ideas for movies to check out.</p><p>Remember, the world of cult classics is vast and varied, so don't be afraid to explore and discover new favorites. Who knows - you might just find your new favorite movie!</p></article>
