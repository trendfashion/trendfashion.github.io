The sishebo was made up of three pieces: the blouse, the skirt, and the headwrap. The blouse was a fitted, long-sleeved top with intricate beadwork around the collar and cuffs. The skirt was a full, flowing garment that reached the floor and was decorated with a matching beadwork pattern. And the headwrap was a large, brightly-colored scarf that was draped over my head and shoulders.</p><p><h3>The Symbolism of Swazi Traditional Attire for Married Women</h3></p><p>Swazi traditional attire for married women is full of symbolism and meaning. From the colors and patterns of the garments to the way they are worn and accessorized, every aspect of traditional attire holds special significance.
