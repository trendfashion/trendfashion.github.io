That being said, there are still cultural norms to be aware of, such as avoiding overly revealing clothing and removing shoes when entering someone's home.</p><p>In terms of what type of clothing do they wear in Japan, casual clothing is generally accepted in most situations. This could include jeans, t-shirts, and sneakers. However, it is important to keep in mind the weather conditions and dress accordingly. For example, summers in Japan can be hot and humid, so it is best to wear lightweight and breathable clothing.</p><p>To summarize, the type of clothing worn in Japan largely depends on the occasion and cultural norms.
