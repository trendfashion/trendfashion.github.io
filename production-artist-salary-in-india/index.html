Those working in major cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore may be able to command higher salaries than those working in smaller cities or rural areas. This is because the cost of living is generally higher in major cities, which can drive up salaries.</p><p>Personally, I've found that working in Mumbai has allowed me to earn a higher salary than I would have in my hometown. However, it's important to consider the cost of living when evaluating potential job opportunities, as a higher salary may not necessarily mean a better standard of living.</p><p><h4>Negotiation</h4></p><p>Finally, it's important to note that negotiation can play a significant role in determining your salary as a production artist. Many employers are willing to negotiate salaries with employees, especially those with valuable skills and experience.</p><p>When negotiating your salary, it's important to do your research and understand what others in your industry and location are earning.
