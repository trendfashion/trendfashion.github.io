The fight is brutal and intense, and the black-and-white cinematography adds to the film's gritty, realistic feel.</p><h3>The Fighter</h3><p>The Fighter is a more recent addition to the pantheon of great boxing movies. This film tells the true story of Micky Ward, a boxer from Lowell, Massachusetts, who is trained by his half-brother Dicky Eklund. The film is known for its incredible performances by Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale, who won an Academy Award for his role as Eklund.</p><p>One of the most memorable scenes in The Fighter is the final fight between Ward and Arturo Gatti. The fight is a brutal slugfest, with both fighters taking and giving incredible amounts of punishment. The scene is a testament to the heart and determination of both fighters, and it's a fitting end to a great film.</p><h4>How to Watch These Films</h4><p>If you're looking to watch these great boxing movies, there are a few options available to you.
