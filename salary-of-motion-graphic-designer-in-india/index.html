Additionally, the industry is highly competitive, which can lead to lower salaries as designers try to undercut each other.</p><p>The average salary of a motion graphic designer in India ranges from INR 3 lakhs to INR 8 lakhs per annum, depending on experience, skills, and location. Junior designers with less than two years of experience can expect to earn an average of INR 3 lakhs per annum, while senior designers with five or more years of experience can earn up to INR 8 lakhs per annum. Designers in major cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore tend to earn higher salaries than those in smaller cities or towns.</p><p>To summarize, the salary of motion graphic designers in India varies depending on factors such as experience, skills, and location.
