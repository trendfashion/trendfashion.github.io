Some people believe that women do not have the strength or endurance to compete at the same level as men. Others think that women's boxing does not attract as much attention as men's boxing, and therefore, the sport is not as popular. These are just some of the challenges that female boxers have faced over the years.</p><p>So, who is the greatest woman boxer of all time? The answer to this question is not that simple.
