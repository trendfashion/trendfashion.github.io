Fast fashion refers to the trend of producing cheap, disposable clothing at a rapid pace. This has led to a culture of overconsumption and waste, as well as exploitation of workers in countries where labor laws are lax.Slow fashion, on the other hand, is all about creating clothing that is high-quality, timeless, and sustainable.

KotnKotn is a Toronto-based brand that specializes in high-quality, affordable basics made from Egyptian cotton.
