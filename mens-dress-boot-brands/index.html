Personally, I own a pair of Allen Edmonds boots and can attest to their durability and comfort.Allen Edmonds boots are made with a Goodyear welt construction, which means they can be resoled multiple times and will last for years.

This British brand has been around since 1879 and is known for its handcrafted boots and shoes.While Crockett &amp; Jones boots may be more expensive than some other brands, the quality is unbeatable.
