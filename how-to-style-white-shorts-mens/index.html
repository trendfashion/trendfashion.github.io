A simple white t-shirt or button-down shirt is a great option for a casual look. You can also add a denim jacket or blazer for a more dressed-up look. Accessorize with a belt, watch, and sunglasses to complete the outfit.</p><p>In summary, when it comes to how to style white shorts mens, keep it simple and pair them with basic pieces. Choose the right shoes and accessories to complete the look.

The first step is to read the care instructions on the label. Some white shorts may require special care, such as hand washing or dry cleaning.</p><p>When washing white shorts, use a gentle detergent and wash them in cold water.
