The groom should also wear a turban, which is an important part of the attire.</p><p><h2>Personal Experience</h2></p><p>When my brother got married, he wore a beautiful sherwani in a deep maroon color.

The sherwani or kurta is an important part of the attire and reflects the rich cultural heritage of India.</p><p><b>Q:</b> Can the bride and groom wear matching attire?</p><p><b>A:</b> Yes, the bride and groom can wear matching attire, but it is not a common practice in Hindu weddings.</p><p><b>Q:</b> What kind of jewelry should the groom wear?</p><p><b>A:</b> The groom should wear traditional jewelry like a necklace, earrings, and bangles.
